# carddealer

### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python3 installed.
2. Clone this repository. To do this, run ```git clone https://github.com/ritvikjay/carddealer.git``` in your terminal. This will create a local repository on your computer.
3. Run ```cd carddealer``` to move your terminal's working directory to this repository.
4. Create a file called ***credentials.py*** in this repository. To do this, you can open some text editor and save the file in the folder that you cloned. In this folder, write

```
CREDENTIALS = {
  "USERNAME": "<Insert your Facebook Username ID here>",
  "PASSWORD": "<Insert your Facebook Password here>"
}
```

You can find your Facebook Username by searching for your name in Messenger, and it will be the text after the last backslash in the URL.

5. Run the program by running ```python3 [PROGRAM NAME]``` in the terminal (while your working directory is this repository).

This should get everything running! Reach out if it doesn't.
